## üîß Installation

JAFS supports multiple installation methods to accommodate different user preferences and environments.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Method 1: From Source (Recommended for Developers)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JoelHJames1/MultiAgentAISystem.git
cd MultiAgentAISystem

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python -m jafs.main --task "Hello, world!"
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

Once installed, you can start using JAFS right away:

```bash
# Run JAFS with a simple task
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python -m jafs.main --task "Find the latest news about artificial intelligence"

# Run with a specific mode (single, multi, or auto)
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python -m jafs.main --mode multi --task "Research quantum computing"

# Run with verbose output
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python -m jafs.main --verbose --task "Calculate 2 + 2"
```

## ü§ñ Running with Ollama

JAFS has built-in support for running with Ollama, which allows you to use open-source models locally. Here's how to set it up:

### 1. Install Ollama

First, you need to install Ollama on your system. Visit [Ollama's website](https://ollama.ai/) for installation instructions.

### 2. Pull a Model

After installing Ollama, pull a model that you want to use:

```bash
# Pull a model (e.g., qwq:32b, llama3, mistral, etc.)
ollama pull qwq:32b
```

### 3. Configure JAFS to Use Ollama

Edit the `config.yaml` file to use Ollama:

```yaml
# JAFS Configuration File

model:
  provider: ollama
  model_name: qwq:32b  # Replace with your preferred model
  base_url: "http://localhost:11434"  # Default Ollama API URL
  temperature: 0.7

agent:
  name: jafs
  mode: auto  # Options: single, multi, auto
  max_iterations: 10
  memory_capacity: 2000
  verbose: true

tools:
  enabled:
    - calculator
    - search
    - text
    - code

logging:
  level: DEBUG
  file: logs/jafs.log
```

### 4. Run JAFS with Ollama

Now you can run JAFS with Ollama:

```bash
# Run JAFS with Ollama
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python -m jafs.main --task "Calculate 2 + 2"
```

### 5. Troubleshooting Ollama Integration

If you encounter issues with Ollama integration:

- Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Verify the model is available: `ollama list`
- Check the base URL in config.yaml matches your Ollama setup
- Ensure the model name in config.yaml matches an available model

## üìã Usage Examples

### Basic Examples

#### Simple Question Answering

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python -m jafs.main --task "What is the capital of France?"
```

#### Calculations

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python -m jafs.main --task "Calculate 3 * 4 + 5"
```

#### Multi-Agent Mode

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python -m jafs.main --mode multi --task "Research the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare"
```
